# The Deprecation HTTP Header Field

The HTTP Deprecation header field can be used to signal to consumers of an URI-identified resource that the use of the resource has been deprecated. Additionally, the deprecation link relation can be used to link to a resource that provides additional context for the deprecation, and possibly ways in which clients can find a replacement for the deprecated resource.
