                      The Deprecation HTTP Header
                 draft-dalalwilde-deprecation-header-00

Abstract

   The HTTP Deprecation header field can be used to signal to consumers
   of a URI-identified resource that the use of the resource has been
   deprecated.  Additionally, the deprecation link relation can be used
   to link to a resource that provides additional context for the
   deprecation, and possibly ways in which clients can find a
   replacement for the deprecated resource.

1.  Introduction

   [Deprecation] of a URI-identified resource Section 1.2.1 is a
   technique to communicate information about the life cycle of a
   resource: to encourage applications to migrate away from the
   resource, to discourage applications from forming new dependencies on
   the resource, and to inform developers of the risks of continuing
   dependence upon the resource.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

Internet-Draft         The Deprecation HTTP Header          January 2019


1.2.1.  Resource

   The key abstraction of information in [REST] is a resource.  Any
   information that can be named can be a resource: a document or image,
   a temporal service (e.g. "today's weather in San Francisco"), a
   collection of other resources, a non-virtual object (e.g. a person),
   and so on.  A resource is a conceptual mapping to a set of entities,
   not the entity that corresponds to the mapping at any particular
   point in time.  More precisely, a resource R is a temporally varying
   membership function "MR(t)", that for time "t" maps to a set of
   entities, or values, that are equivalent.  The values in the set may
   be resource representations and/or resource identifiers.

2.  The Deprecation HTTP Response Header

2.1.  Syntax

   Deprecation: since=<date or version>; sunset=<date>;

   To Erik, Mark: We could use Sunset header if it is going to be
   approved.  Else we would use a key named "sunset".

   *Since*

   The value of "since" could be the resource (or API) version since
   when this resource was deprecated.  For APIs, that use date-based
   versioning scheme, the value could be accordingly.

   Following example indicates that the resource in context has been
   deprecated since version "v2".

   Deprecation: since=v2

   Following example shows that the resource in context is deprecated
   since 2018-11-08 (November 8, 2018).

   Deprecation: since=2018-11-08

   *Sunset (optional)*

   The value for "sunset" would be an HTTP-date timestamp, as defined in
   Section 7.1.1.1 of [RFC7231].  This information provided as a hint
   allows a service to communicate the fact that a resource is expected
   to become unresponsive at a specific point in time.

2.2.  With Link Header

   Link header as defined in [RFC8288] could be used in addition to the
   Deprecation header to inform the applications about alternates to the
   deprecated if applicable.  Following relationship types as defined in
   [RFC5988] might be appropriate to use in such cases.

   o  successor-version

   o  latest-version

   o  alternate

   Following example provides link to the successor version of the
   resource that is deprecated.

   Deprecation: v2
   Link: http://api.example.com/v2/customers; rel=successor-version

   Following example provides link to an alternate resource to use
   instead of the called resource that is deprecated.

   Deprecation: 2018-11-11
   Link: http://api.example.com/v2/clients; rel=alternate

3.  The Deprecation Link Relation Type

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  The Deprecation Response Header Field

   The "Deprecation" response header should be added to the permanent
   registry of message header fields (see [RFC3864]), taking into
   account the guidelines given by HTTP/1.1 [RFC7231].

       Header Field Name: Deprecation

       Applicable Protocol: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

       Status: Informational

       Author/Change controller: IETF

       Specification document(s): RFC XXXX

4.2.  The Deprecation Link Relation Type

   The "deprecation" link relation type should be added to the permanent
   registry of link relation types according to Section 4.2 of
   [RFC8288]:

       Relation Name: deprecation

       Description: ...

       Reference: RFC XXXX

5.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security

6.  Example

7.  Implementation Status

   Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section before publication.

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC6982].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to RFC 6982, "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".
